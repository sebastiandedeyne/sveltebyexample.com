# Svelte by Example

[Svelte by Example](https://sveltebyexample.com) is a succinct, gentle introduction to Svelte & SvelteKit to pique your curiosity. If you want to dive deeper, we recommend reading through the Svelte tutorial & docs.

Svelte by Example is built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). Content is stored in `content`, and uses a superset of markdown that gets parsed in the `build-content` script.

To run Svelte by Example locally:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```
